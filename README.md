From a frontend perspective, the project is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface for the email management system. The web application communicates with a backend server that handles the email functionality and the database.

The web application has the following features:

-   A login page that allows the user to enter their email address and password to access the system. The web application validates the user credentials and redirects them to the dashboard page if they are valid, or shows an error message if they are invalid.
-   A dashboard page that displays the user’s name, email address, role, and a menu of options. The web application uses conditional rendering to show different options depending on the user’s role. For example, if the user is an admin, they can see an option to manage the system settings, while if the user is a normal user, they can only see options related to their email account.
-   An inbox page that shows the list of emails received by the user, with the sender’s name, subject, date, and status (read or unread). The web application uses pagination to show a limited number of emails per page, and allows the user to navigate between pages. The web application also allows the user to sort and filter the emails by different criteria, such as date, sender, subject, or status. The web application uses AJAX to fetch the emails from the server without reloading the page.
-   A compose page that allows the user to create a new email and send it to one or more recipients. The web application uses a form to collect the recipient’s email address, subject, and message from the user. The web application validates the form inputs and shows an error message if they are invalid. The web application also allows the user to attach files to their email. The web application uses AJAX to send the email to the server without reloading the page.
-   A sent page that shows the list of emails sent by the user, with the recipient’s name, subject, date, and status (delivered or undelivered). The web application uses pagination, sorting, filtering, and AJAX similar to the inbox page.
-   A settings page that allows the user to change their personal settings, such as account password. The web application uses a form to collect the new password from the user. The web application validates the password and shows an error message if it is invalid. The web application uses AJAX to update the password on the server without reloading the page.
-   A notification system that sends an email to the user on their birthday. The web application uses a service worker to register a background task that runs periodically and checks if there is any user whose birthday is today. If there is, it sends an email to them using the server API. The web application also shows a notification on other users’ dashboard if it is someone’s birthday today.

The web application uses responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The web application also uses local storage to store some data locally on the browser for faster loading and offline access. The web application follows accessibility guidelines to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities.
